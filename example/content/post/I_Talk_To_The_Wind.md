Said the straight man to the late man

"Where have you been?"

I've been here and I've been there

And I've been in between


I talk to the wind

My words are all carried away

I talk to the wind

The wind does not hear

The wind cannot hear


I'm on the outside looking inside

What do I see

Much confusion, disillusion

All around me


I talk to the wind

My words are all carried away

I talk to the wind

The wind does not hear

The wind cannot hear


You don't possess me

Don't impress me

Just upset my mind

Can't instruct me or conduct me

Just use up my time


I talk to the wind

My words are all carried away

I talk to the wind

The wind does not hear

The wind cannot hear


I talk to the wind

My words are all carried away

I talk to the wind

The wind does not hear

The wind cannot hear


The wind does not hear

The wind cannot hear
